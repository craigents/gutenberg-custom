  1. Project Overview

  Project Name: Gutenberg Theme
  Brief Description: Develop a modern, high-performance, and accessible WordPress theme built entirely around the Gutenberg block
  editor. The theme will serve as a foundational framework for [specify target use-case, e.g., non-profit websites, educational
  institutions, corporate blogs], emphasizing a clean design, intuitive user experience, and adherence to the latest web standards.

  Overall Goal: To create a production-ready WordPress theme that showcases the power and flexibility of Gutenberg blocks, provides an
  exceptional user and editor experience, and serves as a robust, maintainable base for future website development.

  2. Target Audience & Core Purpose

  Primary Users:
   * Website Administrators/Editors: Non-technical users who will primarily interact with the Gutenberg editor to create and manage
     content. They need an intuitive, flexible, and visually consistent editing experience.
   * Website Visitors: End-users accessing the public-facing website. They expect fast loading times, a responsive design across all
     devices, and an accessible experience.

  Core Purpose: To provide a highly customizable and performant WordPress theme that empowers content creators to build rich, engaging
  layouts directly within the Gutenberg editor, without requiring custom code.

  3. Core Requirements (Minimum Viable Product - MVP / Phase 1)

  This initial phase focuses on establishing a solid foundation and delivering a set of essential, well-implemented features.

   * Theme Structure:
       * Standard WordPress theme hierarchy (index.php, functions.php, style.css, etc.).
       * Clean, semantic HTML5 markup.
       * Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
   * Gutenberg Block Integration:
       * Develop a set of core custom blocks (e.g., Hero Section, Call-to-Action, Feature Grid, Testimonials, Contact Form, Header,
         Footer, Navigation).
       * Each custom block must have:
           * A block.json for proper registration and metadata.
           * edit.tsx for intuitive editor controls (e.g., RichText, MediaUpload, TextControl).
           * save.tsx for clean, performant frontend output.
           * Dedicated SCSS files for editor and frontend styling.
       * Blocks should be designed for maximum reusability and flexibility (e.g., using InnerBlocks where appropriate).
   * Design System Adherence:
       * Implement Material Design 3 (M3) Web Components for interactive UI elements (buttons, inputs, etc.) to ensure a consistent and
         modern aesthetic.
       * Strict adherence to M3 design principles for spacing, typography, and color.
   * Styling:
       * Utilize SCSS for all styling, organized into a modular, component-based architecture.
       * Define a clear color palette using CSS variables, based on M3 guidelines.
       * Define typography using Google Fonts, ensuring consistent font families, weights, and sizes across the theme.
       * Integrate Google Material Icons for all iconography.
   * Performance:
       * Achieve a Lighthouse score of 90+ for Performance on desktop and mobile for a basic page with content.
       * Implement lazy loading for all images (both <img> tags and CSS background images).
       * Ensure efficient asset loading (e.g., minification, concatenation via wp-scripts).
   * Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance):
       * All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable and operable.
       * Proper ARIA attributes for custom components (e.g., navigation, dropdowns).
       * Sufficient color contrast ratios.
       * Semantic HTML structure.
   * Development Workflow:
       * Use @wordpress/scripts for block development, compilation, and local development server.
       * Implement TypeScript for all JavaScript-based development.
       * Configure PHP_CodeSniffer with WordPress Coding Standards for PHP linting.
       * Configure PHPUnit for PHP unit testing.
       * Configure Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript unit testing.
       * Maintain a clean and well-documented codebase.

  4. Technical Stack & Rationale

   * WordPress: Latest stable version.
   * Gutenberg: Native block editor for content creation.
   * Frontend Framework: React (for block development)
   * Language: TypeScript (for type safety and maintainability in frontend development)
   * Styling: SCSS (for modularity and advanced CSS features)
   * Design System: Material Design 3 (M3) Web Components (for a modern, consistent, and accessible UI/UX out-of-the-box).
   * Build Tools: @wordpress/scripts (official WordPress toolchain for block development).
   * PHP Version: PHP 7.4+ (or latest stable supported by WordPress).
   * PHP Dependency Management: Composer.
   * PHP Coding Standards: WordPress Coding Standards (via PHP_CodeSniffer).
   * Testing Frameworks: Jest (for JS/TS), PHPUnit (for PHP).
   * Version Control: Git.

  5. Design & User Experience (UX) Vision

   * Aesthetic: Clean, modern, and professional, with a focus on readability and user engagement. Leverage Material Design's subtle
     shadows, rounded corners, and clear hierarchy.
   * Color Palette: Primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors defined as CSS variables, adhering to M3 color system recommendations.
   * Typography: Use "Karla" from Google Fonts for all text, with clear hierarchy for headings, body text, and UI elements.
   * Iconography: Exclusively use Google Material Icons.
   * Animations: Subtle, performant animations and transitions (e.g., hover effects, menu reveals) that enhance the user experience
     without being distracting.
   * Responsiveness: Flawless adaptation across all screen sizes, with mobile-first considerations.

  6. Out of Scope (for MVP / Phase 1)

   * Complex custom post types or taxonomies (beyond standard WordPress functionality).
   * Advanced e-commerce integration (e.g., WooCommerce).
   * Complex user authentication systems.
   * Multi-language support (beyond basic i18n setup).
   * Full end-to-end testing (will be a future phase).
   * Advanced SEO optimizations (beyond semantic HTML and basic meta tags).

  7. Success Metrics (for MVP / Phase 1)

   * All defined custom blocks are fully functional and editable within the Gutenberg editor.
   * Theme passes all PHP_CodeSniffer linting checks with zero errors.
   * All JavaScript/TypeScript unit tests pass.
   * Theme achieves a Lighthouse Performance score of 90+ on a basic content page.
   * Theme is fully responsive across common device breakpoints.
   * All core features are accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).
